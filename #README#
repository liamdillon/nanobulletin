Nanobulletin, a completely featureless bulletin board.

Loosely based on the blog application found in the Flask tutorial.

In order to run it, follow the instructions found in INSTALL.  Then, start it up with "python nanob.py".  Flask runs on port 5000 by default, so visit http://localhost:5000/ to have a heated discussion with yourself on your message board of one.
